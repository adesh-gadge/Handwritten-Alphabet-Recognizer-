# Handwritten-Alphabet-Recognizer-
The data set comes from the Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition. The goal is to recognize digits 0 to 9 in handwriting images.I have utilized na√Øve Bayes, kNN and SVM algorithms. Tuned their parameters to get the best model (measured by cross validation) and compared which algorithms provided better model for this task.
